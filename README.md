Project: Apple Product Purchase Analysis using PySpark & Databricks

Description:
Designed and implemented an end-to-end ETL data pipeline using Databricks and PySpark to analyze customer purchase patterns of Apple products. Integrated multiple data sources (CSV, Parquet, Delta Table) using the Factory Pattern for dynamic data ingestion. Applied business transformation logic with PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL to derive insights such as:

   1) Identifying customers who bought AirPods after purchasing an iPhone.
   2) Finding customers who purchased both AirPods and iPhone.

Processed data was loaded into Data Lake and Delta Lakehouse environments for optimized storage and analytics.

Tech Stack:
Databricks, PySpark, Apache Spark, Delta Lake, Data Lakehouse, SQL, Factory Design Pattern

Key Contributions:
    Developed reusable ingestion logic using Factory Pattern.
    Improved query performance and scalability with Delta Lake.
    Delivered actionable insights through optimized business logic.
